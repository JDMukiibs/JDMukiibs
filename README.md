### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Joshua Daniel Mukiibi. A budding final year computer engineering student at Middle East Technical University. Currently employed as a software developer working with Flutter to develop mobile applications. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basics of Data Science following the Applied Data Science specialization from University of Michigan offered on Coursera.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently in my final year at Middle East Technical University. And I'm also doing some personal work which will be displayed up on my hub when it's fleshed out. :innocent:
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about basketball, musicals, and anything software development related. Hopefully, If I know it I can answer, if not well StackOverflow + Google :wink: 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @joshuamukiibi10 on Twitter and joshuamukiibi10@gmail.com is my email address
- âš¡ Fun fact: Idk if this should be about me or the world but I'll go with me. I can't use a jump rope :sweat_smile:
